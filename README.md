A study of massive planetary-scale forces as potential triggers for earthquakes. We are using a combination of Random Forest and Time Series machine learning techniques. 

Factors analysed are:
    1. Time elapsed since the most recent full or new moon (tidal forces)
    2. Proximity to other recent magnitude 7 earthquakes (dynamic stress transfer)
    3. Time since last earthquake in the locality (strain accumulation)
